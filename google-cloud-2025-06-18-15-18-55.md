Okay, so I need to process this transcript into a structured Markdown document as per the user's instructions. Let me start by reading through the entire transcript carefully to understand the content and identify the key sections.

The transcript is an overview of Google Cloud's AI Protection product. It starts with David McConney introducing the session, then goes into discussing the risks associated with AI, followed by a demo of their solution. There are several parts about visibility, risk engine, model armor, runtime threats, and deployment options.

First, I'll need to break this down into major sections using level-2 headings. The main topics seem to be:

1. Introduction
2. Overview of AI Protection
3. Key Features (Visibility, Risk Engine, Model Armor, Runtime Threats)
4. Deployment Options
5. Topics Summary
6. Action Items

I'll start with the first section, which is an introduction. Then move on to the overview explaining why AI protection is necessary and how it works.

Next, I need to identify the sections that detail each feature. The transcript mentions visibility, risk engine, model armor, and runtime threats as key features. Each of these can be a separate subsection under their respective main sections.

For the Topics Summary, I'll condense the main points from the transcript into a brief paragraph highlighting the primary risks addressed and the solution provided.

Finally, Action Items should list any specific steps or information mentioned, like the QR code for guidance or consulting services offered by Mandiant. If there are none, it should say "None."

I need to ensure that each section is properly formatted in Markdown with appropriate headers and bullet points. I'll also make sure to include all relevant details from the transcript without missing any key points.

Let me start drafting each part step by step, making sure to follow the structure closely.

## 3. Key Features of Google Cloud AI Protection
### Visibility
- Automates discovery of all AI assets, including models, datasets, and APIs.
- Scans training and tuning pipelines to identify sensitive data lineage.

### Risk Engine
- Uses virtual red teaming to identify toxic combinations and potential threats in AI pipelines.
- Also scans notebook environments for insecure open-source packages (OSS).

### Model Armor
- Protects against prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious files through integrated security controls.
- Available via REST API or Vertex integration with inline policy enforcement.

### Runtime Threats
- Detects active threats such as anomalous model behavior and persistence attempts.
- Leverages threat intelligence from Mandiant and Google to surface real-time issues.
